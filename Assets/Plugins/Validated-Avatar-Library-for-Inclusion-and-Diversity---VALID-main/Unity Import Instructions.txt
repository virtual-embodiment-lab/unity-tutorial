All avatars have embedded textures and materials. Unity usually does not extract them automatically. Below are instructions on importing and animating sample avatars

1. Import the avatar into your Assets folder
2. Using the Inspector, go to the "Materials" tab of the asset's Import Settings 
3. Click "Extract textures" and "Extract Materials"
4. Go to the"Rig" tab of the asset's Import Settings
5. Select Animation Type: Humanoid 
6. Select "Create From This Model" 

Avatars should now be ready to animate.

NOTE: 
If you are using an avatar with long hair, you need to apply the hair shader in /HairShader to the wig game object to turn off mesh culling. By default, Unity culls two-sided meshes.
